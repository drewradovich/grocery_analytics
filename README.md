# Revenue Management - Grocery Data
This is a project using grocery inventory data from a Kaggle dataset. Data is included on product names, categories, suppliers, unit pricing, stock, and reorder levels.
In MySQL, I imported the data file from Excel, following duplicate removals, and checked data integrity by searching for null and missing values. I then performed exploratory data analysis by looking at top-selling product categories, price changes over the course of the year, monthly inventory levels for products, and flagging products below their reorder level.
